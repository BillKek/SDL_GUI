# SDL_GUI
GUI for SDL2 without directly using OpenGL

This project is somewhat based on the structure of [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui) by Wenzel Jakob

This is a GUI aimed at SDL2 users who have a project that is exclusively written in SDL2, and who only wish to use the inbuilt texture and surface rendering and not directly call OpenGL. 

The Nano name has been dropped as this project does not use the OpenGL based NanoVG graphics library but instead uses the SDL2 rendering functions.
